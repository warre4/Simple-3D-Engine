# Simple-3D-Engine

A side project for fun inspired by the Doom Engine projects and videos from [3DSage](https://github.com/3DSage).

I wanted to do a C project and I found the techniques used in these videos intriguing so I'm gonna make my own version and play with it.

This is also a good oppertunity to learn cmake so I'm using cmake for this project.
